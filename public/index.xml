      <description>This digital garden is part of my daily work flow. This post talks about exactly what that work flow is, how that fits into this digital garden space, and how I plan to customize this garden to fit the work flow.&#xA;Geaux Flow First of all, the Geaux Flow is what I call my daily work flow. As silly as the name is, it helps me to have a name for technical purposes like tagging tasks in the tools I use (Obsidian, Logseq, VS Code).</description>

      <description>This is my special corner of the internet in which you will find ideas, stories, notes, bookmarks, and many other things that I think are useful. It took me a while to publish my public workspace on the web, but it is finally here after finding the perfect template to publish my site with - thank you to Varun for sharing this open source project.&#xA;I am using the Hugo Digital Garden Theme theme created by Varun A P, a very talented front-end engineer.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I am Alexander the Great - what is it that you want?&amp;rdquo;, asked one of the great conquerers in human history. &amp;ldquo;To stand out of the sun a bit&amp;rdquo;, replied Diogenes, one of the founders of the cynic philosophy.&#xA;Alexander the Great was so impressed by the homeless philosopher&amp;rsquo;s disdain for him that when he was walking with his soldiers (who were laughing and commenting on how absurd they found the man laying in the barrell), he made the legendary remark, &amp;ldquo;For if I weren&amp;rsquo;t Alexander the Great, I would be Diogenes.</description>

      <description>This article is sort of a placeholder for learning about WeisMind and the story behind creating this project. This information will be on the WeisMind website when it is finished, but for now you can check out my digital garden post for explaining the story behind WeisMind!&#xA;WeisMind Creative It has been a while since I last created anything for WeisMind. That would have been a few years ago when my girlfriend Lisa and I created an episode of the WeisMind podcast.</description>

      <description>SupaSnake.js is a remake of the all-time classic &amp;ldquo;Snake&amp;rdquo; game, where the user controls a super hungry snake who is on a mission of a lifetime, trying to consume as manny &amp;ldquo;apples&amp;rdquo; as he possibly can. Little does he know that with each apple he happily devours, he is one apple closer to his death!&#xA;Tech Stack Next.js Supabase Tailwind CSS Typescript Project Status (Maintaining) I am maintaining this project by making sure it continues to work.</description>
