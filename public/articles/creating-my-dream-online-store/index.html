Let&rsquo;s rewind the tape a bit, all the way back to April of 2021.</p><p>Andrew is trying to launch his first Shopify ecommerce store but thinks he can not do so without the help of a developer. In a way, he is partially right, but he doesn&rsquo;t realize the potential within himself to learn this skill an implement his own solution. But I do better learning by failure and pain, so that is the path I embarked on.</p><p>I was contacted by a friendly enough Canadian &ldquo;designer, developer, and marketer&rdquo;, advertised as something not too far off of what my Tar Heel Dev Studio freelance business now does. He convinced me he was going to help me get my site lifted off the ground by helping design and build the thing, while also setting up marketing and running it for a month. There is a reason I put &ldquo;designer, developer, and marketer&rdquo; in quotes at the beginning of this paragraph.</p><p>Money was really tight at the time, but I at least had enough capital to pay him $1500 to help with all of this. His design and programming was basically just mirroring the site of my supplier. His tech skills were the opposite of what he said and he got me kicked off Facebook advertising immediately for stealing exact posts from my supplier. He probably spent an entire hour to do everything that should have taken a lot more time, but certainly was ok with taking my money and trying to disappear by using the excuse of &ldquo;I was pissed off and being a dick to him when he was just trying to help me get rich bro&rdquo;, and tried to gaslight me until I finally just blocked him.</p><p>I eventually was able to get my money back through Bank of America (rest in peace - not), but it was painstakingly difficult and left me without much needed funds for a bout 100 days. Don&rsquo;t scam me bro, I&rsquo;ve got a very specific set of skills and I will find you and I will kill your scam efforts by using the financial system and laws to gt my money back. Don&rsquo;t know if that would work these days, but I am a persistent bastard and got that money back. But it ultimately led to the downfall of my first attempt at building an ecommerce store, something I wanted to do for a long time.</p><p>This made me realize that I needed to upskill myself and learn programming.</p><h2 id=born-a-nerd-always-a-nerd>Born a Nerd, Always a Nerd</h2><p>I was searching for jobs and figuring out how I should approach learning programming. I had tried to learn before, practically in another life though (the summer after college) but my interest was always there and I always loved investigating things on my first computer, the Compaq Presario. I would change various settings and observe what it did to the computer. I would dig through all the program files and read any that had a <code>.txt</code> ending to learn how it worked.</p><p>My first thought of having a career in tech was when I was in sixth grade. I had this awesome video game magazine and inside of it they talked about some college that was basically a computer science heaven and they had a game developer program. It talked about how they all spent late hours in labs working on their respective degree and games they were building and that the university offered unlimited Mountain Dew in their campus buildings, which was a nice thing for them to do and as a six grader I thought it sounded awesome. I would often think about that article I read and how cool that would be - sitting and working on a computer late at night while sucking down Mountain Dew.</p><p>While it could have inspired me to go down that route in life, I got convinced that making computer games is extremely difficult and that there is no way that I was smart enough to do that - plus, there wasn&rsquo;t any money in tech things like computers and games, right? Yeah, I mean I tried out electrical engineering my first year in college and progressed from Civil Engineering to Construction Management, but ultimately came out of college with a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Business Administration, practically a useless piece of paper that tells people that I can&rsquo;t commit to any particular discipline or skill set and that I can&rsquo;t be trusted to do anything outside of cusotmer service and sales.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been super curious and a passionate learner and reader. I couldn&rsquo;t settle for such a piece of shit degree like BA, so I went back to school to get my Master&rsquo;s in Economics and made a decent way through some of the program with good grades before dropping out and moving back to Montana on a whim - I was going through a really difficult time in my life and things kind of went through a weird cycle of: try something new at school, get a job, do that for a while, and repeat. That is until I came to North Carolina where a whole lot is about to go down.</p><p>Since arriving in North Carolina to this very moment, I have become a very different person. It&rsquo;s a better person, but very different than who I was before I came here. I&rsquo;ll talk about this another time because I&rsquo;ve got to tell the story about my new ecommerce project, but it is one you will want to read whenever I have time to write it down. We&rsquo;ll just jump right to where the story left off with the Canadian guy.</p><p>So after the Canadian scam artist fiasco, I got very interested in learning programming and also a major event pushed me to getting a job in cyber security. Do you remember the Colonial Pipeline Ransomware attack in 2021? Well, that made me super interested in cyber security because there would be good jobs and interesting jobs. I ended up interviewing with this company that used to be called CyberOpz, but now is Iron Range Cyber I think? Anyways, I worked there for about six months before getting let go because I had a mental health episode - yes I know, not cool but it was good experience.</p><p>Losing that job was kind of the beginning of a lot a of bad things that happened, but it led to me learning how to code!</p><h2 id=change-of-plans>Change of Plans</h2><p>Well after losing that job, I needed to find a new one. I had a hard time however, which sometimes makes me think that my cyber security job didn&rsquo;t do me any solids if potential employers contacted them - not sure or making a slanderous statement, just a thought. I applied for nearly a thousand jobs over the next couple of years and kept getting denied. I had probably 50 interiews and none of them offered me a job. Well, one did but that&rsquo;s a whole other story.</p><p>But during this time I decided to go all in on Full-Stack development. I&rsquo;m a big picture kind of guy, so I figured this was the right choice for me and it was. I loved learning coding (I still do!) so much, I could sit and program for days on end. But the tough job market, not understanding how important DSA was, and an immense amount of stress was all getting to me. On top of trying to get a job, Lisa and I dealing with our housing assistance abruptly stopping their help which led us to getting behind rent for 5 months, something we couldn&rsquo;t afford to overcome. The next place we moved after that was a really bad company who kicked us out, basically on Christmas - this was even when I had $7,000 to cover our late rent but they didn&rsquo;t want us there I guess.</p><p>Another story for another day, but the last two and a half years have been me trying to find time (and places) where I can code, there&rsquo;s been times I&rsquo;ve had my computer stolen, and other times it&rsquo;s just been too hard to do it because I&rsquo;m without housing - there&rsquo;s a million different reasons why I can&rsquo;t code, but I&rsquo;ve kept figuring out how to overcome these barriers. I&rsquo;ve always had grit, but a quick self brag: Lisa and I are on a whole other level of grittiness. I can&rsquo;t really begin to tell you what all we&rsquo;ve been through together these last couple of years, but my god we can endure a lot of pain, I&rsquo;ll tell you that much.</p><p>The longest I went without a computer was about two or three months after it was stolen one day when I got heat stroke, but other than that I&rsquo;ve always had my machine. The funny thing about it all is that I have become a much better developer, which I credit to my situation. I&rsquo;m about to work on article about why all the terrible things that have happened to me are an incredible blessing. Maybe you&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s crazy, but I think I&rsquo;m right.</p><p>Back to the main story now: it&rsquo;s been nearly four years on a whole roundabout trip from initial goal one, designing and coding my own ecommerce store, all the way through about a million other goals, and we are back at goal one. Since Lisa is my best friend, fiance, lover, and I&rsquo;m her sidekick, this is now our plan and shared goal I&rsquo;m enacting. We&rsquo;ve been talking about this idea for two years now and just never figured out exactly what industry or what niche.</p><h2 id=grit--recycled-second-hand-goods-economy--outdoor-gear--computer-science---tariffs>Grit + Recycled Second Hand Goods Economy + Outdoor Gear + Computer Science - Tariffs</h2><p>Well we currently reside in a delapitated tent that we sorely need to replace, but simply can&rsquo;t afford to and its really sad. I&rsquo;ve been applying for jobs, studying my ass off, and trying to figure out a way to get hired and lift us up from our situation. Our perspective has certainly changed and I have a different outlook on life and have become a new person. But that doesn&rsquo;t change we need money to be able to afford housing.</p><p>With everything happening, I&rsquo;ve been increasingly stressed out about getting some income rolling in until I get a job and I plan on doing a few things, but we recently have put a couple of things together and have found the idea to work on first. The idea is that we will sell used outdoor gear and dropship some newer things that are affordable - but mainly focus on used goods. The only reason we are going to start with dropshipping new stuff is to bring in some income so we can get more inventory.</p><p><a href=https://hackers.town/@CyberpunkLibrarian/114298178826944251 target=_blank rel=noopener>This Mastodon post I saw today was the perfect post to discover today</a>. There are no tariffs on recycled goods - that is an awesome point. I feel like that is a sign we are onto something.</p><h2 id=will-we-succeed-will-we-fail-either-way-we-are-doing-it>Will We Succeed? Will We Fail? Either Way, We Are Doing It!</h2><p>It&rsquo;s funny how life works - it never goes how its supposed to. Well really, how we think its supposed to go. Life is really hard and I don&rsquo;t know why things seem to always do the opposite of what I want them to do, but I&rsquo;ve learned to be okay with that. I&rsquo;ve learned failure is a wonderful learning tool, that you can find happiness in any situation when you look for it, and that the worst thing that can ever happen to you isn&rsquo;t as bad as you think.</p><p>If you want to help us out, feel free to contribute to the project and share it with your social media network and people you know, that would be incredible! Thank you for reading this long post and I will share more updates as the project comes along.</p><p>I bid a farewell and adieu.</p></article></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/main.js defer></script></body></html>
