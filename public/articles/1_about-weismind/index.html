      <p>Welcome to the temporary home of <strong>WeisMind</strong>, a rad studio that creates content that sharpens your mind so you have the only weapon you&rsquo;ll ever need to defeat fear, fight ignorance, and discover truth, love, and happiness.</p>
<p>It is likely that you were directed here via the WeisMind Newsletter - yes, you are on the correct page to learn about WeisMind. I&rsquo;ve got a lot going on right now since I just launched WeisMind, on top of trying to find full-time employment as a full-stack developer, creating a lot of other content, and trying to get out of my current situation that I am in.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to use precious newsletter space explaining my story and why I created WeisMind, nor did I want to drive away readers from the useful and entertaining content. There are a lot of things I want to write about that would take away form the meat and potatoes of the newsletter, so you can find all the extra ramblings, thoughts, and other topics I talk about here on the digital garden until I finish the WeisMind website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know I mentioned this in the first newsletter, but I am actively creating zines that you can either purchase, offer a donation, or receive for free for being a paid subscriber to the WeisMind newsletter! I also offer print versions for an extra cost or fee. I&rsquo;ll share the Gumroad link where you can purchase them when they become available.</p>

<h2 id="weismind---over-two-years-in-the-making">WeisMind - Over Two Years in the Making</h2>
<p>Now two years in the making doesn&rsquo;t mean that I was at a desk by a candle lit lantern, furiously scribbling away notes while piecing together some intricate web of characters to create the perfect story. Unfortunately, the real story is much less glamorous, but necessary to share for a few reasons I&rsquo;ll get to in a moment. Best get the hard part for me over with first&hellip;</p>
<p>The main reason WeisMind has been such a large undertaking for me is due to the fact that I have been homeless (with my fiance Lisa) for about two and a half years now. There, I said it! I mean, the people that know me in the world probably know this, but I&rsquo;m sure there are a number of people who have no idea what I&rsquo;ve been up to recently.</p>
<p>It used to be painful for me to admit that to other people and it used to bring me a great deal of shame, which isn&rsquo;t surprising considering the fact that our society treats homeless people worse than they treat their own dog (literally). But honestly, I&rsquo;ve gotten to a point where I could give less of a fuck about what you think of me and there really isn&rsquo;t much anyone could do to me that would bother me. I&rsquo;ve gotten to a really good place in my life where I understand what is important to me and what isn&rsquo;t, and that is a really awesome place to get to in life - I doubt that there are many people who ever experience what I am talking about right now and it is hard to understand that unless, well IYKYK.</p>
<p>You probably won&rsquo;t meet too many homeless people that will tell you what I&rsquo;m about to say, but becoming homeless is actually the greatest thing that has ever happened to me in my life. I&rsquo;m being dead fucking serious too. No, I&rsquo;m not crazy so you&rsquo;ll just have to stay with me here to get what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<h2 id="gotta-hit-bottom-to-go-well-maybe-ill-just-keep-going-down-">Gotta Hit Bottom To Go&hellip; Well, Maybe I&rsquo;ll Just Keep Going Down 🤷‍♂️</h2>
<p>Beleive me, I didn&rsquo;t always have such a positive perception of being homeless and in fact, most of the time I&rsquo;ve been homeless it has been an utterly miserable existence that has a few moments of being ok here and there. There are still times where it absolutely sucks to be homeless, like when there are big thunderstorms that bring heavy winds, tornadoes, and my least favorite thing of all, lightning.</p>
<p>You see, sleeping in a tent when there is a lightning storm really sucks. But when you are crammed in a tent with a bunch of conductive belongings, a conductive girlfriend and kitty, and your tent is in an open field outside of a small forest, you will never be able to be outside when there is lightning ever again. Imagine that lightning is striking just a couple dozen yards away from you and you want to go somewhere safe, but you can&rsquo;t because your homeless and nowhere is open since its night time.</p>
<p>Other than lightning, there are also the other annoyances - having to pee when its freezing outside, or even just trying to stay warm when its freezing outside. Not having money to get food or anything most of the time is a pain in the ass - and save your &ldquo;get a job&rdquo; comments, because I tried working at Walmart but they treated me like shit and I have a college degree plus have been doing freelance full-stack software development for over four years, so I don&rsquo;t need to work at Walmart. It&rsquo;s also just really hard to work somewhere when it&rsquo;s hot as hell in the summer and you really never sleep, kinda like me.</p>
<p>But despite all the really awful things about being homeless, I do believe it was really good for me to go through this. Being homeless has given me a really unique perspective that I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people ever get to experience. I&rsquo;ve also developed a level of grit that can&rsquo;t be topped by probably anyone. I don&rsquo;t know too many people who would continue to create software and learn about computer science for free while starving in the winter or hot North Carolina summer, all just for the chance of trying to get a job that&rsquo;s good enough to afford getting out of this situation and into housing - that is fucking grit.</p>
<p>Some of the crazy, hard shit I&rsquo;ve gone through would crush most people - yet I&rsquo;m here today, writing this post while also coordinating my newsletter you&rsquo;re also reading, working on my new digital garden, and creating a zine that I can try to sell to make some money. This is all after waking up to a chilly low-thirty degrees at about 3:30 AM on the hard floor of our tent because our air mattress somehow got popped and I woke up shivering and uncomfortable. At least my kitty Bean was snuggling with me. 😊</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to solicit sympathy, nor do I want you to think I&rsquo;m just a crazy homeless nutjob. I&rsquo;m merely trying to paint a picture of what my day to day life is so you can understand why it took me two years to get this newsletter launched. I think it&rsquo;s helpful to give people a taste of what homelessness is really like so they can understand it better, and it helps coming from somebody who is in most respects, quite a normal dude who is quite intelligent but has made a few mistakes that have really been compounded by bad luck and being in a shittiest place you can make life mistakes in - the south.</p>
<h2 id="the-fascism-factorial-theory-and-how-it-got-to-this-point">&ldquo;The Fascism Factorial&rdquo; Theory and How It Got To This Point</h2>
<p>Before I dive into this next part, let me make it clear that I accept full responsibility for my actions in my life and have done an incredible amount of work that should be more than enough to ammend what I may have &ldquo;done to deserve this&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not shifting blame or twisting the truth, this is how I have been stuck here for two and a half years.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we have a time machine, sort of like in Back to the Future - I know your fucking excited for this now!</p>
