      <description>Welcome to the temporary home of WeisMind, a rad studio that creates content that sharpens your mind so you have the only weapon you&amp;rsquo;ll ever need to defeat fear, fight ignorance, and discover truth, love, and happiness.&#xA;It is likely that you were directed here via the WeisMind Newsletter - yes, you are on the correct page to learn about WeisMind. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot going on right now since I just launched WeisMind, on top of trying to find full-time employment as a full-stack developer, creating a lot of other content, and trying to get out of my current situation that I am in.</description>
