      <description>This is my special corner of the internet in which you will find ideas, stories, notes, bookmarks, and many other things that I think are useful. It took me a while to publish my public workspace on the web, but it is finally here after finding the perfect template to publish my site with - thank you to Varun for sharing this open source project.&#xA;I am using the Hugo Digital Garden Theme theme created by Varun A P, a very talented front-end engineer.</description>

      <description>I started Tar Hee Dev Studio back at the end of 2021 when I first started looking for developer jobs. What started out as a brand to help market my freelance services has become my primary source of income and my most valuable work experience as a developer.&#xA;Freelance Studio for Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs, and Non-Profits I didn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate the developer job market to go through tough times like it did, so I was kind of forced to figure a way out to get by while learning how to be a better programmer - well, it&amp;rsquo;s a never ending journey, but what I mean is that I stepped right into the fire when it came to working on my first real project that made me money.</description>
