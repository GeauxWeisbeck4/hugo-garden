And the most simple and effective way to help is donating directly to Cash App and Venmo. I'm looking to add other ways to donate, but donating via these methods is the most helpful way to give. I say that because there is no fee that we get charged (platforms take like 5-10% sometimes) and it goes directly into our pocket so we can feed ourselves and save up for housing.

Just click on the image and it will take you straight to the donation page. You can also look up the usernames included in the section title.
