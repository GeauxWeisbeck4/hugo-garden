Creating websites, content, and learning takes up an immense amount of time, but doing this kind of work makes me feel awesome and the challenge is a pretty good reward. However, being challenged and feeling awesome doesn't pay a whole lot - it pays nothing in fact. Freelancing isn't as lucrative as it once was since everyone is now a "vibe coder" and finding work as software developer is challenging at the moment.

My partner and I have been struggling with homelessness for nearly two and a half years now, but we have been working tirelessly to try and figure out how to get out of our situation. There is no easy way out and I have been working endlessly at learning more, creating more, and applying for jobs, but it is a slow and sometimes frustrating process.

That all being said, I don't expect to be gifted a way out of this mess. Even if it seems unfair to us, there is no bail out and we have to create our own luck, our own way out. That doesn't mean we can't ask for help along the way though, but I feel like there is a reasonable token of exchange that I can offer while asking for help. That is what I am offering when I create content, projects, and other things that help inform others and provide entertainment (I hope that's what I do at least) and you can help out in a few different ways.

## Thank you for helping!

You have no idea how much your help means to us and helps us out - it has been a difficult last two and a half years. We have been trying our hardest to make ends meet and figure out how to find help, create opportunities for ourselves, and do the right thing. There aren't a lot of great resources here in North Carolina and the mentality of a lot of people is that we should pull our bootstraps up, work at McDonalds, or just figure it out. 

The way we got into this situation was a failure on our part, the part of the housing program that was supposed to help us, and the courts. [You can learn more about what happened in this post](/content/articles/about-weismind.md) if are curious.

Your help also motivates us to help others. After we get out of our situation, we have pledged to do whatever we can in our power to help other people who are struggling like we are. We understand their pain, their needs, and what can be done to help them out most effectively.
