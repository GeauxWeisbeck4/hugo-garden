These are publications I create content on and they typically have ways you can sponsor me, subscribe to my content, or even sometimes just visiting and sharing these pages will help me earn money. If you can't afford to help out with a subscription or donation, definitely sharing these with your network has a huge impact.

## Substack - The WeisMind Newsletter & Geaux Code Newsletter

These are both brand spanking new newsletters that are just about to drop. 

## Hashnode - GeauxCode.dev

My software and web development blog where I write tutorials, discuss dev topics, and more.

## Medium - Personal Blog and WeisMind Content

One of my older blogs I've had for a while and getting active with again. You can help me by just reading articles as a Medium member.

## Dev.to - Developer Blog

Another dev blog with content about things I'm learning and want to share with the broader dev community.

## Hackernoon - Coming Soon
