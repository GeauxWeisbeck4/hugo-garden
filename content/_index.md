## **Welcome to my digital garden! 🌲** 

A digital garden is like a personal wiki and a knowledge database of thoughts and ideas. Similar to a traditional garden, a digital one will also container various kinds of content (plants), of which may even be unrelated to each other. Ideas are not refined, thoughts are not tailored. Here is an excellent write-up about the [history of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

I am working on integrating my [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) site to my digital garden as I think it is the perfect tool for cultinvating my own 'corner of the internet'. Don't know what I mean by that? Check out `Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet` [post](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) by MIT technology review
