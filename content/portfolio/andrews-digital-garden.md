description: My digital garden a public knowledge sharing website that showcases projects, notes, and content I'm writing.
---

This is my special corner of the internet in which you will find ideas, stories, notes, bookmarks, and many other things that I think are useful. It took me a while to publish my public workspace on the web, but it is finally here after finding the perfect template to publish my site with - thank you to [Varun](https://github.com/apvarun) for sharing this open source project.

> I am using the [Hugo Digital Garden Theme](https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/) theme created by [Varun A P](https://apvarun.com/), a very talented front-end engineer. If you like this site and want to support him or find more of his work, check out his [Buy My A Coffee Site here](https://buymeacoffee.com/apvarun) where you can purchase his next cup of study juice, or whatever he uses your donations for.

## Tech Stack

- Hugo Static Site Generator
- JavaScript for Searching, Dark/Light Mode Switch, Graph, and more
- Tailwind CSS for Styling
- Markdown for content

## Project Status (In-Progress)

This project is a work in progress as it has taken me some time to finally publish my digital garden to the public. That being said, it will also take me quite some time to add content, create more content, and style the front end to the way I see fitting for each type of content. That is the fun in a digital garden though, right?

Here are some things I am working on right now:

- **Stories Collection**: Stories are like my own version of the "seedlings" concept in digital gardens. They are ideas, article drafts, project tasks, and anything else that I work on without the expectation of forcing it to become a post or anyting else. Something may come of it, something may not, but it is a way to work with an idea until it takes form.
- **Notes Catalog**: Working on the structure of my note catalog and how to best share individual and note collections.
- **Donation Page**: A way to contribute to help me out without having to leave the site.
- **Bookmarks/Resources**: A page that shares all my bookmarks and resources in an easy to view way.

## Challenges

### Challenge One - Finding the right tools and interface for my large collection of notes and such

- I have a huge collection of notes, projects, code snippets, bookmarks - you name it, I got it. The problem is that I always end up trying to publish them using something that is either not efficient or it doesn't share my knowledge space in the way I want it to be shared.
  - Yes, "if you want it done right, then do it yourself" is the appropriate response to that problem. But I just have not had the time available to dedicate to creating a solution for my digital garden that will make me happy. I know that's a sorry excuse, but I have been spending all my time focusing on trying to get a full-stack developer job, so this is the solution we all get.

### Challenge Two - Figuring out the right backend solution organize, filter, and store content

- Right now this isn't a priority, but it will become something I want to focus on here very soon. Logseq and Obsidian work great for storing content locally and they are easy when it comes to exporting notes and such. But what if I want to make my content accessible on my phone? What if I need to edit all my content before publishing it to keep security access keys and such out? What if my computer crashes? What if the FBI comes to my house, smashes my computer to pieces for no reason, and then tell me that is what I get for disagreeing with the current administration?
  - These are all valid concerns (maybe the last one is a little less likely, right now - they'd probably just deport me to a Venezualan prison). I will probably use a CMS like Strapi or Tina, but more likely will go the route of something light and easy to setup like Decap CMS (I still think it should be Netlify CMS).

## Goals

Here are the goals I want to achieve with this project:

1. Share projects and content I'm working on and get feedback from readers.
2. Provide potential employers with a way to see how I think and solve problems.
3. Share content in a visually appealing way and that content is useful for others.
