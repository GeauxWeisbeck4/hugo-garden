SupaSnake.js is a remake of the all-time classic "Snake" game, where the user controls a super hungry snake who is on a mission of a lifetime, trying to consume as manny "apples" as he possibly can. Little does he know that with each apple he happily devours, he is one apple closer to his death!

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 
- Supabase
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

## Project Status (Maintaining)

I am maintaining this project by making sure it continues to work. There are a few features I am working on adding:

Project Tasks:

- Add arrows so it can be played on mobile phone.
- Improve graphics and layout

## Challenges

1. Figuring out how to get the collision of the snake and apple to calibrate correctly.
2. Building a full-stack version required some utility functions it took me a little while to figure out.

## Goals

1. Demonstrate full-stack skills by building a full-stack app for a classic game.
2. Share with family and friends and see who can get the highest score.
3. Make it fully functional where the user can play game with no interruption and score can be updated after game is over.
