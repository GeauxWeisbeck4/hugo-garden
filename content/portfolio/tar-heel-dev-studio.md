# [Tar Heel Dev Studio Website](https://tarheeldevstudio.com)

I started Tar Hee Dev Studio back at the end of 2021 when I first started looking for developer jobs. What started out as a brand to help market my freelance services has become my primary source of income and my most valuable work experience as a developer. 

## Tech Stack

- Astro.js Static Site Generator
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

## Project Status 

This project is my main source of income so it is always a work in progress. Right now, I am trying to focus on finding full-time employment so I have slowed down on trying to find clients lately, but that could always change. I am always taking clients, so never hesitate to reach out to me if you are interested in hiring me.

## Challenges

1. Managing many projects at once: This is a natural challenge when you are a one man show. I have solved this by hiring other freelancers at times or by setting expectations with clients.
2. Finding clients: There are times where it is very difficult to find clients. Really the only solution is to continue pushing through until something works out.

## Goals

1. Create an open source project that is useful to others and gets over 1,000 stars on GitHub.
2. Start creating more SaaS projects.
