I started Tar Hee Dev Studio back at the end of 2021 when I first started looking for developer jobs. What started out as a brand to help market my freelance services has become my primary source of income and my most valuable work experience as a developer. 

## Freelance Studio for Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs, and Non-Profits

I didn't anticipate the developer job market to go through tough times like it did, so I was kind of forced to figure a way out to get by while learning how to be a better programmer - well, it's a never ending journey, but what I mean is that I stepped right into the fire when it came to working on my first real project that made me money.
