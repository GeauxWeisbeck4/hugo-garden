My latest project is the reason I started learning programming in the first place - well, the first shot that started the war I guess you could say because I think I was always destined to get into programming due to my love of computers and tech. But it all got started when I was sick of not being able to build my own tools, especially my own ecommerce store. Over four years later, I'm finally here and ready to implement my long-desired Shopify store.
