This digital garden is part of my daily work flow. This post talks about exactly what that work flow is, how that fits into this digital garden space, and how I plan to customize this garden to fit the work flow.

## Geaux Flow

First of all, the Geaux Flow is what I call my daily work flow. As silly as the name is, it helps me to have a name for technical purposes like tagging tasks in the tools I use (Obsidian, Logseq, VS Code). It also helps me to write about it as having a name makes it easier to refer to as my "work flow" is somewhat vague - that could refer to my coding work flow, writing work flow, whatever. Geaux Flow is my specific productivity work flow I use each day to track what I do, how I do it, and to help plan and coordinate my days.

The Geaux Flow consists of three main parts - the morning flow, planning, and focus sessions. The morning flow includes my 10 minute freewriting session, which is very important to me. My 10 minute freewriting session is how I get my head cleared after waking up and get myself focused before getting to work. I then spend about 30 minutes to an hour reading either a book or relevant coding articles. After that, I do some coding exercises to warm the brain up.

After my morning flow comes the planning part of my day. I start out by creating a to-do list in Logseq to get an idea of what needs to be done. I also write down a to do list in my planner notebook so my girl friend Lisa and I can be on the same page each day. After that, I break down the tasks into what needs to be a story (more on that shortly, what needs to be a task, and what can be set aside as not important as either a task or story.

Stories become an important part of my productivity work flow as they can either become a piece of content, a new project, or are a critical part of a project I'm working on or something that needs to get done during one of my sprints. A sprint refers to the two week sessions I use to plan out projects, content, and tasks so I can see how much progress I'm making over time and how I can adjust my work flow to be more effective. Currently, I am in the middle of Sprint 18, week number two and have a lot to catch up on this week.

Tasks and stories can be organized into each focus session I have during a day. I try to complete at least three focus sessions a day, alternating two 90 minute periods with two 60 minute periods, both timed using a Pomodoro Timer in Logseq. On average, I complete about four or five a day when I am staying on task. I would like to create my own app that tracks this and serves as a journal to better track my statistics and efficiency.

## The Digital Garden

So this digital garden is pretty new, so it isn't fully customized to fit my work flow how I want it to quite yet. I have set aside a section for stories that is a work in progress, but I would also like to figure out a good way to display sprints and what each sprint contains. 

I have a note catalog in my digital garden and that is something new that I am adding to the Geaux Flow. I take a lot of notes when I am learning during focus sessions, but they aren't always very complete, nor do they do a good job of filtering out the most useful information. What I would like to do is use this digital garden as a way to rewrite my notes into more structured and easy to comprehend and read notes. 

## Conclusion

There is still a lot of work to be done in this digital garden, lots of content to add, and I'm always adjusting my Geaux Flow to fit my needs and better track my productivity. If you have any questions on how I do something, feel free to open an issue on GitHub and ask a question!
