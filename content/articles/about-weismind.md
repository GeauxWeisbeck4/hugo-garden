This article is sort of a placeholder for learning about WeisMind and the story behind creating this project. This information will be on the WeisMind website when it is finished, but for now you can check out my digital garden post for explaining the story behind WeisMind!

## WeisMind Creative

It has been a while since I last created anything for WeisMind. That would have been a few years ago when my girlfriend Lisa and I created an episode of the WeisMind podcast. We were really proud of our little show we had, but we were unable to keep up with it due to some unfortunate circumstances over the last couple years that have been difficult to overcome.

Back then it was *WeisMind Consulting*, my marketing, content creation, and business consulting company. Ever since we had to stop recording episodes, I have wanted to bring the brand back to life in the form of a newsletter, blog, or some other kind of creative medium. The name WeisMind, is a silly play on wise and the first part of my last name Weisbeck, combined with the second part which is mind. Isn't that so cute?

## Stuck and Going Nowhere Anytime Soon

There's a lot to this story and I will get to more details as time goes on, but one of the first things that caused us to stop doing the WeisMind podcast was losing our housing. Over two years later and we still haven't recovered - that is a long time to go without housing and it really can get you down at times. 

There wasn't a whole lot we could have done different because it ended up kind of being out of our control, but people don't care about the truth - all people care about are the judgments they make and what they believe, so it has been an extremely trying last couple of years for us. We've tried getting menial jobs and that couldn't sustain us getting housing. We've tried looking for resources, but there really aren't many for a young white couple who don't qualify for any kind of help, if there really is even much help at all here in the southern state of North Carolina.

There's no point in getting into all the details of what we've had to go through except that no human deserves to be treated the way we've been treated from the time of losing our housing when I had money to pay the rent to every moment until now. We see dogs that are treated better than we are and it can be really upsetting at times, so much so that there are times where you just can't help but cry and feel like giving up.

But we haven't budged an inch on our efforts to change our situation, and in fact, some really beautiful things have occurred for us. Those things that I'm about to discuss are what I want to focus on, because they have given me the strength to start up WeisMind and to realize that I have a lot I can share with people that can help them out, especially during times like these that we find ourselves in here in America.

## A Quick Note

I just want to make this very clear - I am not saying that you should try to go to extreme lengths to learn the lessons that I have, nor am I trying to romanticize being homeless. I am doing everything I possibly can to change my situation, like trying ot find a decent full-stack developer job and create content and digital products. It often feels like we will never get anywhere, but we won't give up and I know that we will get out of this as long as we keep fightning for it - any donations, paid subscription revenue, or product purchases you make will go directly to helping us off the street and we appreciate it y'all!

Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the good part of all of this.

## All About Perspective

So you might call me crazy or think I'm full of shit, but going through homelessness and living an extremely tough life the last couple of years is probably the best thing that happened to me. I'm not saying I love it and want to be out here forever and I'm also not saying that I like being homeless, because I really don't. When I get a developer job or if I somehow get the money to get a place or a hotel room, I will do it in a heartbeat. Let me explain what I mean by the statement, "best thing that happened to me."

Before we lost our housing and ended up on the street, I was constantly stressed about so many different things, I was unhappy no matter what was going on, and I lacked appreciation for everything that I had during that time. I would do anything to be back in that situation at times and I get mad at myself sometimes when I realize how good I had it compared to living in tent in the heat and humidity of North Carolina. But somehow I was just so lost and hated myself for some reason.

Now it took some time for me to see this, but the only thing that was making me miserable at the time was because of my perception of the situation. I was worried about being unemployed, trying to afford my rent, and focused on what I didn't have compared to everyone else. Many things out of my control made my life difficult and rather than see the truth in that, I got angry at how unjust and unfair everything was and angry at myself. Looking back, I now see there was nothing I could have done because I was playing a rigged game I couldn't win, and continuing to try and win the game would only ever end up with me not liking my life.

It was even like that for probably about 14 months of being homeless and it kept getting worse and worse, this feeling that I was such an utter failure and my life was so fucked up that I couldn't do it anymore. I constantly felt like my chest was bein  crushed by the pressure of being me and that the shame of my life radiated for the world to revolt from in disgust at the waste of everything htat could have been, had somehow turned into this thing that should be reviled. It was so heavy that I felt like I was being crushed alive and wanted everything to end, but I had already failed at suicide once in my life so I knew I couldn't do that successfully.

In my head, I had created this idea of myself and made up a whole story about who I was. I believed it for so long that it was a set in stone fact, just like the 10 commandments were when God gave them to Moses, if you are a believer or follower of God. Oh the pressure was going to finally just crush me and it did - it reached the breaking point to where I couldn't handle it for a second longer and the weight broke through and was supposed to crush me, but it didn't crush me like it should have. In fact, I felt lighter than I had ever been in my life, because something important dawned on me - I had decided to stop trying to prevent that weight from crushing me.

I was so scared that if I didn't keep fighting my whole life to hold up the weight of meeting expectations, the pressure of being what people wanted me to be, and the crushing force of trying to be happy all the time, that I would be crushed into nothingness - basically that I would have to just die or something because what the hell would I be living for? Isn't that what we're supposed to do, what society tells us we have to do, even if it seems like it will crush us?

Well that answer came after the crushing weight had finally became too much and I couldn't handle it any longer. I had collapsed under the pressure, but it wasn't what I thought it was - I couldn't handle it anymore, but it didn't crush me. Instead, I had decided to just let it go this time. What I felt afterwards was the single most incredible moment in my life.

The whole time I was fighting, struggling to balance this crushing weight, I didn't realize that to get rid of it I just had to let it go. I understand how terrifying it would be to do that, but in the end, it was the most freeing thing I've ever done in my life. Maybe it was easier for me because I had to lose everything to find the courage to let go, but when I finally did, I realized that it was all an illusion that was created to suffocate me.

## Seeing Through the Illusion

The change was sudden and it almost felt like I had gone crazy at first. But after going a few weeks realizing that I was happier than I had ever been in my life and that this is what freedom felt like. And this was in the midst of one of the hottest summers I could ever remember and I was living outside in a tent, sweating like a dog but felt happier than I ever had in my life.

This clarity enabled me to see things for how they were for more than just a few moments, for the first time in my life. Aye, I had tripped on LSD and Auyasca, but those trips end quickly and you come back to earth. This was a forever thing that helped me see that we are all trapped in an illusion, created by someone else who wants us to fall in line with their idea of what we should be. And usually that goes against our best interests and we end up miserable.

Once you can realize this, you can have true freedom. You can lose everything you thought was important and feel like you will be ok. Nobody can have power over you once you crack the illusion and see it for what it is. You'll realize that any power that anybody has over you is freely given to them and you can take it back, if you want.

One of the core truths that we have a hard time accepting is that the base condition of humans is suffering and discontent - this is what was taught by Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad. They were all great, because they could see this and describe it to the rest of us in eloquent ways that inspired us to create entire ways of lives around their teachings. But what we fail to realize, underneath all the sacred text, the preachings, and prayer, it's just one truth. 

If we can accept that truth and see it for what it is, we can be free and understand that nothing is as bad as we think it is. True freedom is freedom of mind, being free from letting people control our thoughts. The only way they can do that is if we let them. 

This is what I realized when I decided to let go of everything that had made me blind to seeing reality. It was the most incredible gift that I could have ever received. It would have been nice if I didn't have to go through what I did to get to this point, but some of us are not great listeners despite having the message screamed at us by life in so many ways.

## WeisMind is About Expanding Your Mind

Now, I can't teach you all that myself. I can write it down, put it in a newsletter, and ship it off everyday for thousands of years to come and still have nobody have that same experience or understanding of life. I just wanted to share that because it is relevant to why I am writing this today. This experience has made me feel like I have a purpose in my writing, in myself, and in my life.

WeisMind is about sharing things I've learned with people who are seeking knowledge, a useful skillset, and to read something that comes from the heart and contains wisdom. I can't promise you that I am going to make you rich, that my words will set you free form the bondage of pain, nor that I can fix your problems. But what I can promise is that I will try my best to share things with you that will help you in your journey to finding your own truth and everything I say will have my best intentions and honesty.

I get it - the world is a scary place right now for a lot of people. I worry everyday as to what is in store for people like me who have no housing and are not currently "employed" by someone other than themselves. When I wake up every morning, I have to figure out how I am going to be able to eat today and where I can use the bathroom without having to buy something. That doesn't bother me as much as you'd think, but it is a challenge nonetheless. I've had to learn to tune out the people who mutter things about me when I am working in public because their opinion of me is irrelevant.

Everything is irrelevant really, other than the happiness that my partner Lisa and I get to feel. Our journey may have unique challenges, but it is no different than yours or anyone elses as we are all flesh and bone and limited only by our own constraints. Anything is possible if you can let yourself be free of the fear of failing - failing is a topic I will talk A LOT about because I think it is great.

Everything is great if you want it to be, you just have to make that choice. Just like the choice I am making to wrap up this post right now.

## Conclusion

So I have shared with you the reason I think WeisMind exists - because I have had an awakening and realized that I have useful knowledge, experience, and skills to share with you. You may be surprised at what I have in store at times. Sometimes I will talk about tech things like how AI isn't as scary as you think, once you understand it. I am writing a 'Zine about the Fediverse right now, planning to write one about protecting your info online, and am going to be sharing a bunch of free alternatives to app subscriptions you pay for.

I'll also write about things like true freedom, positive thinking, and compassion. My hero is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and I think it will be very relevant to talk about him quite often. I'll also listen to what you have to say and suggest because after all, this publication is for you the reader. 

Thank you for learning more about my little project and reading my newsletter. I hope you will at least subscribe to the free edition, which contains every newsletter for free and a good amount of my content - I do that so if you pay, you know you will be really getting something worth your moneys worth. I will see you in future posts here (eventually on WeisMind.com) and in the next newsletter!
