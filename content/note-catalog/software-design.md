# Software Design

Software design is endlessly fascinating and my favorite thing I'm learning right now. Here are my notes, many coming from The Essence of Software: Why Concepts Matter for Great Design, by Daniel Jackson.

## Concepts

- A concept is a self-contained unit of functionality. 
    - A reservation, upvote, or how you organize files in a folder.
    - Well designed and familiar concepts are easy to use, as long as they are represented faithfully in the user interface and programmed correctly. 
    - Complex or clunky concepts are difficult to use, no matter how great algorithms are.
